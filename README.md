# LocusZoom Standalone

This repository is for the command line (standalone) version of LocusZoom, an application for creating regional plots from genome-wide association studies built in Python and R.

Documentation for this program is available on our wiki: http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LocusZoom_Standalone

# Status

This version of LocusZoom is no longer under active development. Bug fixes and small updates may be made, though it is unlikely. 

A new web-based interactive version of LocusZoom is currently under active development. Please see the [locuszoom.js github site](https://github.com/statgen/locuszoom/) for information on using it on your own sites, or see a preview of it in action at [locuszoom.org](http://locuszoom.org/locuszoomjs.php).
