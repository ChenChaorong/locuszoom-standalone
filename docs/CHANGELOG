1.2:
----

Bug fixes:
-- dbmeister.py would complain about not being able to find which
-- which() would fail if a dir on the user's PATH did not exist
-- SQL queries for variant annotations and other tables were run even if the tables did not exist
-- locuszoom tries to find Rscript and run locuszoom.R accordingly, rather than assuming Rscript was located in /usr/bin/ (can also now change RSCRIPT_PATH in conf file)

Features added:
-- support for March 2012 1000G for computing LD (ASN, AFR, EUR, AMR)
-- lifted over variant annotations from hg18 to hg19
-- updated SNP positions and gene boundaries from snp137 and latest refFlat (as of 2013-01-22)

1.1:
----

Bug fixes: 
-- hitspec with blank lines would cause crash 
-- hitspec with alternative line endings (unix, windows, etc.) would cause crash
-- hitspec without proper number of columns would crash, proper warning now issued
-- if a SNP's position could not be found when processing hitspec file, program would crash instead of skipping it
-- program would crash if sqlite was not available, now issues proper warning
-- genes would not be displayed at all in the event that all genes in region could not be fit into track below plot
-- if a reference SNP was given as chr:pos but existed in LD files as rs# (or vice versa), plot would be entirely gray 
-- better support for 1000G SNPs (all SNPs are converted to chr/pos internally as a result) 
-- SNPs in hitspec file that were from an earlier genome build were not being translated into the current genome build (instead, it would complain about not finding a position) 
-- users running R 2.13.0 would get a crash regarding a missing library include
-- fixed issue where some gzipped files would cause a crash 

Features added: 
-- support for hg19 (for 1000G populations, hapmap will no longer be provided)
-- support for metabochip LD 
-- added --no-ld option, will force locuszoom to skip calculating LD
-- added a warning when metal file contains both rsID and chr:pos SNP names to make sure user selects proper genome build

Features removed: 
-- removed the --hits option, this was no longer used and is superseded by --hitspec
-- removed support for pre-computed LD (this was not being maintained, bloated the code, and often was a "cache miss") 
-- (CSG internal version) removed SQL database connections, now runs entirely from sqlite database

1.0.3:
------
-- fixed bug where metal files with p-values only within the range [0.1,1] were double -log10 transformed
-- fixed bug in dbmeister.py where indices were not being created after inserting a new snp_pos table, resulting in absurdly long runtimes
-- fixed bug where user supplied database would cause a crash in certain instances (especially forcing offline mode with --offline 1) 
-- changed how gzip/bzip2 files are detected (no longer depends on file extension) 

1.0.2:
------ 
-- added LD files for 1000G June 2010 release
-- added additional populations to LD files for 1000G Aug 2009 (now includes YRI and CHB+JPT). 
-- added support for automatically converting between 1000G chr:pos format and rs# format for SNPs when a difference exists between the user's association results file and LD genotype files (try to use rs# naming if possible, as this is less error prone)
-- fixed bug in LD cache where a reference SNP with no LD able to be computed would cause a crash
-- fixed bug where blank lines in the user's association results file would cause a crash
-- changed --ld to allow for both relative and absolute paths
-- changed error message to read "locuszoom.R" instead of previous "metal2zoom.R"

1.0.1:
------
-- fixed crash if user's python was not compiled with bz2 support
-- fixed --cache None, this will now properly skip creating a LD cache file

1.0:
----
-- initial release
